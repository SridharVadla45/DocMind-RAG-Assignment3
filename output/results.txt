Answer: Based on the Nova Scotia rules of the road, you must yield to pedestrians in the following situations:

*   **At Intersections:** Drivers must yield to pedestrians at all intersections, whether the crosswalk is marked or unmarked.
*   **At Traffic Signals:** Pedestrians have the right of way when crossing with a green signal, including over vehicles that are turning across their path.
*   **During Signal Changes:** If a traffic light changes to yellow or red while a pedestrian is still in the street, you must allow them to complete their crossing safely.
*   **When Turning:** When making a right or left turn, you must wait for pedestrians to cross if they are in your path.
*   **Stopped Vehicles:** You must not pass any vehicle that is stopped at a crosswalk to allow a pedestrian to cross the street.
