Answer: In Nova Scotia, the rules for passing a school bus are as follows:

*   **Amber Flashing Lights:** These lights alert you that the bus is about to stop. You are allowed to pass, but you must use extra caution and be alert for the red flashing lights.
*   **Red Flashing Lights:** When a school bus is stopped to pick up or discharge students, it will display alternating flashing red lights and a mechanical STOP sign. You must stop your vehicle whether you are behind the bus or approaching it from the front. 
*   **Prohibitions:** You must not pass a school bus with alternating flashing red lights at any time or place, from either direction. This rule applies even on a divided boulevard.

Drivers should be especially careful during school bus operating hours (generally 7–9 am and 2–4 pm) and watch for children who may dart into the street near bus stops.

Answer: When approached by an emergency vehicle (such as a police car, ambulance, or fire department vehicle with flashing lights and sirens) from ahead or behind, you should follow these steps:

*   **Move to the right:** Pull over to the right edge or curb of the road.
*   **Stop completely:** Bring your vehicle to a full stop.
*   **Stay stopped:** Remain in that position until the emergency vehicle has passed or until a peace officer directs you to move.

Additionally, you must never follow an emergency fire vehicle within 150 metres, and you must not drive or park within 150 metres of an emergency vehicle that has stopped to investigate a collision or provide assistance. You are also prohibited from driving over a fire hose unless instructed to do so by a firefighter or police officer.

Answer: In Nova Scotia, the maximum speed limit is set at 50 km/h in the following situations:

*   **Residential and Business Districts:** Unless otherwise posted.
*   **School Zones:** When passing a school building or grounds during recess, during opening or closing hours, or any other time children are present (if the speed limit prior to the school zone was higher than 50 km/h).
*   **School Zone Specifics:** When children are present, the limit is 30 km/h in areas where the approaching speed limit is 50 km/h, and 50 km/h where the approaching speed limit is higher than 50 km/h.
*   **Public Parks:** Within cities or towns, unless another speed is posted.
*   **Intersections:** Within 15 metres of an intersection where your view is reduced to less than 60 metres in either direction (except when on a through highway or at traffic-controlled intersections).
*   **Railway Crossings:** When approaching within 30 metres of a crossing.
*   **Churches:** When passing a church while the congregation is entering or leaving.
*   **Danger Zones:** In any area designated as a danger zone.

Drivers must also adjust their speed based on conditions such as weather, visibility, and traffic. You must never drive faster than the posted speed limit or at a speed that is unreasonable for the prevailing conditions.
